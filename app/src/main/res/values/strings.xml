    <string name="hello_world">Welcome at HypeAudioVisualizer. All you have to do is start music from
        "Google Play Music" or "MP3 Player". The music has to be played in the Background and this app has to be opend.
        Set the IP and Port of your Hyperion and lets go :) If the data rate should be to high for hyperion, you can decrease the data rate in settings.
        BUT: The higher the value, the lower the rate. 2 is as fast as possible. 100 is veeeeeery slow.
